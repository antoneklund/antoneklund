I am an industrial Ph.D. student working at Aeterna Labs and associated with the Foundations of Language Processing group at Umeå University. My research interests revolve around document clustering and topic modeling. Particularly, I am interested in human evaluation of the models and have developed tools for adaptable evaluation methods.
