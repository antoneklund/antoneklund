- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @antoneklund

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.umu.se/en/staff/anton-eklund01/

I am an industrial Ph.D. student working at Adlede and associated with the Foundations of Language Processing group at UmeÃ¥ University. My research interests revolve around document clustering and topic modeling. Particularly, I look at topic modeling done by clustering pretrained language model (PLM) embeddings. I have also developed a tool called STELLAR which is made for analysis and human evaluation of topic models.
